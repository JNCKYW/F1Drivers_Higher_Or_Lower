# F1Drivers_Higher_Or_Lower
I designed and coded one website before but it was only created with HTML/CSS. Recently I ended course section about DOM manipulation so obviously I wanted to practise some of this to get more used to it. And there is no better way of practising something new than coding application all by yourself 😃! 

I love F1 so it was clear to me that I wanted to do something about it. This app is maybe not most advanced one in web but I learnt so much new things in JS while coding it. Also coming up alone with some logic that actually works behind the scenes is something I love most in coding ❤ I just know there is no better way of getting expierience than coding by yourself and fixing problems that would not occur in a perfectly laid course 😅
